# Structured RWA Note Tokenization Infrastructure (Avalanche)

This repository implements a controlled, institution-oriented framework for tokenizing real-world asset (RWA) debt instruments on Avalanche.

The system is designed around SPV-driven issuance, tranche-based risk representation, and restricted transfer mechanics, making it suitable for private credit, real estate–backed notes, and other non-retail financial instruments.

Unlike retail-focused RWA projects, this architecture prioritizes:

Clear separation between issuer (SPV) and investors

Deterministic, auditable yield accounting

Transfer controls aligned with compliance and custody requirements

Clean migration path to Avalanche Subnets for institutional isolation

The goal of this repository is to serve as infrastructure, not a marketplace.
